# Data Processing

To effectively analyze and predict outcomes from Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, the first step is building a comprehensive dataset. This dataset should include PPG readings collected from diverse sources, such as wearable devices, medical-grade sensors, and smartphones, to ensure robust model generalization across different environments and populations. Alongside raw PPG signals, the dataset should also contain relevant metadata, including user demographics (age, gender, and skin tone), device specifications, and environmental factors (e.g., motion intensity and ambient light conditions). Such diversity in data ensures that the models can account for individual and situational variations, enhancing their real-world applicability.

The dataset's structure is centered around raw PPG signals stored in time-series format. Each entry in the dataset represents continuous waveform data captured over specific time intervals, accompanied by corresponding metadata. This format allows temporal patterns and physiological dynamics to be analyzed efficiently. The time-series structure is essential for capturing meaningful features, such as heart rate variability and waveform morphology, which are crucial for accurate predictions.

Data cleaning is a critical step in preparing the dataset for analysis. One effective method for removing noise is Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). VMD is a signal-processing technique that decomposes raw PPG signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), isolating meaningful components while filtering out motion artifacts and high-frequency noise. Unlike traditional filtering techniques, VMD adaptively separates the signal into its underlying components, preserving physiological information critical for analysis. By applying VMD, the cleaned PPG signals become more reliable for feature extraction and downstream machine learning tasks.

This structured and cleaned dataset forms the foundation for developing accurate predictive models, ensuring they are trained on high-quality, representative data. By addressing noise and variability at this stage, the pipeline enables scalable, real-time deployable solutions for PPG-based health monitoring.
