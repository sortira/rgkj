# Introduction

Accurate and real-time prediction from noisy Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals is crucial for health monitoring systems, but challenges such as motion artifacts and scalability hinder their effectiveness in real-world applications. Motion artifacts, caused by user movement, introduce significant noise, making it difficult to extract reliable physiological data. Addressing these issues requires robust algorithms capable of distinguishing signal from noise while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time use. Additionally, scalability is essential for deploying these systems across diverse environments and populations, ensuring adaptability to varying signal conditions. Overcoming these challenges will enable more reliable, accessible, and scalable solutions for real-world health applications.
